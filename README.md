# Test AI Coding Helpers

Would be interesting to compare commercial and FOSS tools on a known codebase.

## Setup at home

Cloud:
deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud

Local, `Continue.dev`
nomic-embed-text:latest
qwen2.5-coder:14b
codellama:34b

To try:

- Qwen3 Coder (480B) (cloud available with ollama) for `Agent` and `Chat`, Qwen2.5-coder for `Autocomplete`.
- Different agents to compare how they work.

## Further integrations

Automate for dev/prod. Use up-to-date tools (e.g.`uv`, `ruff`), automated documentation generation, build and maitain release versions, integration with GitHub/smooth work with local resources.
